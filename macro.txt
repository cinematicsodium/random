The issue in your macro arises from the way the AutoFilter is trying to filter both a specific value (“p”) and blanks (”=”). However, when filtering for blanks alongside another value using Array in VBA, the filter can fail to work as intended.

Solution

You need to address two points:
	1.	Filter blanks and “p” values properly.
	2.	Ensure the Criteria1 argument is correctly formatted to interpret blanks.

Here is the corrected and more reliable version:

Key Fix

Use two consecutive filter calls to achieve the intended outcome. First, filter for blanks (Criteria1:="="), and then add “p” explicitly using an OR filter with Criteria2.

Updated Code

Sub ViewBlanks()
    Const FILTER_COLUMN As Integer = 28
    
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lo As ListObject
    
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Main")
    Set lo = ws.ListObjects("txnReport")
    
    ' Filter to show "p" and blanks
    lo.Range.AutoFilter Field:=FILTER_COLUMN, _
                        Criteria1:="=", _
                        Operator:=xlOr, _
                        Criteria2:="p"
    
    ' Sort by Name
    SortListObject lo, "Name"
    
    ' Sort by Organization
    SortListObject lo, "Org."
    
    Exit Sub
    
ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description
End Sub

Sub SortListObject(lo As ListObject, columnName As String)
    With lo.Sort
        .SortFields.Clear
        .SortFields.Add2 Key:=lo.ListColumns(columnName).Range, _
                         SortOn:=xlSortOnValues, _
                         Order:=xlAscending, _
                         DataOption:=xlSortTextAsNumbers
        .Header = xlYes
        .MatchCase = False
        .Orientation = xlTopToBottom
        .SortMethod = xlPinYin
        .Apply
    End With
End Sub

Explanation of Changes
	1.	Filter for Both Blanks and “p”:
	•	Criteria1:="=" filters blank rows.
	•	Operator:=xlOr, Criteria2:="p" adds “p” values into the same filter.
	2.	Avoid Using Arrays for Mixed Filters:
	•	Arrays are not necessary for filtering blanks and a specific value in AutoFilter.

Outcome

This will correctly filter rows where column 28 has blanks ("") or “p”, and will leave the rest hidden.
